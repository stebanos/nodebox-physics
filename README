NodeBox Physics Library
==================================
NodeBox Physics Library encapsulates physics functionality to be used in SceneBuilder.

You will have to change build.properties to point to your SceneBuilder libraries folder.
This folder should contain:

 * equinox.jar
 * processing-core.jar
 * nodebox-core.jar

The Physics Library uses Phys2D from http://www.cokeandcode.com/phys2d/ , licensed under the zlib license.
